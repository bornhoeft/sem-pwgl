:title "Frequency modulation (FM)"

:bodytext "Frequency modulation (FM) is the most prominently used modulation for musical applications. In its simplest form, frequency modulation can take the form of pitch vibrato , like that used by string instruments. In the seventies, John Chowning developed the technique of auditory rate PM, which modulates a sine wave carrier by a sinusoidal modulator with a frequency faster than 20 Hz. This type of modulation creates side bands (partials on either 'side' - symetrically above and below - of the carrier frequency) in the generated spectrum. These sidebands have the advantage of exhibiting a great deal of spectral flux as the modulation depth, or index, changes. (Modulation depth and index are ways of expressing the amount of modulation that effects the carrier; the greater the modulation depth, or index the more side bands that are present in the modulated spectrum. The relative amplitudes of the side bands are also dependent upon this depth or index.) While these changes are quite different from those found in instrumental spectra , Chowning demonstrated that in many cases the existence of fluctuations is more important than the exact structure of those changes. Therefore, this technique could generate relatively satisfying sounds with only two oscillators, whereas additive techniques, for example, might require dozens or more. This efficiency led Yamaha to license the technique for their synthesizers, starting with th e OX series. In the same way that spectral composers were modeling and analyzing instrumental sounds for the creation of orchestrally synthesized timbres, they also looked to the FM technique. The spectrum produced with this technique is expressed with the following equation: frequency = carrier + and - (index * modulator); where index equals 0, then 1, then 2, etc. until the maximum index value has been reached. The amplitudes of frequency modulated spectra follow relative ly complex functions, which are often left out of simple computation al models. Spectral composers have used this calculational model to integrate electronic FM sounds with instrumental timbres and to create a new category of spectral models for use in all types of pieces."
