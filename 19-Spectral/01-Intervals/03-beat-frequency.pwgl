With tuning instruments that can produce sustained tones, beats can readily be recognized. Tuning two tones to a unison will present a peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not yet identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating. The volume varies like in a tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively. When the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and disappears.

(1)
Two frequencies of 440 and 440.5 Hz resulting in a 0.5 Hz beat frequency.

(2)
Two unisons (c and c sharp app. 262 and 277 Hz) and the interval of the two, a rough sound caused by tthe beat frequency of approximately 15 Hz.
