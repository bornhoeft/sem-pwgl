'filename' is the path of the midi file to be loaded. If 'filename' is equal to (), then an open-file dialogappears.

'scopse' defines the complexity of the quantification of beats. This input can be a number (from 1 to 8), or a list of scope specs. The scope spec list consists of sublists that consist of:
(1) a duration of the beat (1 = 1/4 note),
(2) a list of allowed subdivisions,
(3) a subdivision list of a beat into two halves.
Thus a scope spec sublist:
(1 (2 3 4) ())
allows subdivisions of a 1/4 note of 2,3 and 4, but disallows
subdivision of the beat into two halves (i.e. (3) = ()).

'tempo' can be either a metronome value or a list of metronome values. In the first case the metronome value is used globally for all measures. In the latter case values are assigned to measures one by one. If the tempi list is exhausted before the measures then the last metronome value
is kept constant for the remaining measures. Note that this input has no effect on the quantizing and it is used only to set the metronome values of the measures of the result. If 'tempo' is = (), then the tempo of the midi file is used.

'ignore-rests-p' controls whether rests are used in the result: if () then all rests are quantized, if T then rests are ignored. The latter case can be useful to simplify the result of the quantizing process." :X 5 :Y 22 :WIDTH 730 :HEIGHT 530))) (WINDOW-SELECT WIN) WIN)
