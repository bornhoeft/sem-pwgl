"Here are some shortcuts in PWGL:

*inside a patch
	control-f: sizes everything to fit in the current window
 
*when a box is selected
	v : evaluate
	command+shift+ .   = stop a process when it lasts to long
	d : documentation
	shift + m : minimize (pretty useful to clean up a patch)
	x / y : align two of more boxes (murphy's law : you generally pick the wrong one and it messes everything)

*within a chord-editor
	a : add a note
	left & right arrows : scroll between chords
	up & down arrows (when a note is selected) : change pitch
	tab or shift+tab (when a note is selected) : forward of backward the selected note (in red)

*within a score-editor
	same as chord-editor (except left & right arrows are useless)
		note : in this case, the a key adds a note to another one to make a chord

	esc + r : rhythm mode
	a (in rhythm mode, when the grey rectangle above a note is selected) : add a note
	a (in rhythm mode, when the stem of a note is selected) : add a note and a subdivision (a 1/4 note goes to a 1/8 note, then a triolet, etc.)
	shift+b or shift+a (in rhythm mode, when the stem of a note is selected) : add a grace note before (b) or after (a) the note"
